Parameters to be modified accordingly:

ANGRY_EMOJIS: A list of emojis which are to be considered as expressing an
angry or upset emotion.

EMOJI_COUNT: The minimum number of occurrences of an angry emoji before
the containing sentence is considered an indicator (since not every usage of
emojis, even angry onces, necessarily constitutes an indicator).

CONSECUTIVE_EMOJIS: Whether only consecutively occurring angry emojis should be
considered. This is useful if we wish to only look for the specific use case of
emojis occurring in a row. THIS PARAMETER IS EXPERIMENTAL AND MAY NOT WORK AS
INTENDED!

INPUT: The input string in which to look for angry emojis.
